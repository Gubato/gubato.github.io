    "text": "My name is Luis Daniel Gutiérrez Renero, and I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Audio Engineering from Rec Música Centro de Estudios Musicales, a recognized institution in Mexico with an official academic partnership with Berklee College of Music (Boston, MA).\nMy specialization in music was audio mastering for digital streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.\nAfter graduating, I collaborated on mastering projects with artists including Luis Guinea, Rogelio Edel, and Alec Roqui.\n\nSpotify Playlist\n\nWhile working with these musicians, I also joined a call center company named REDES, specializing in debt collection. I began as an HR Assistant focusing on recruitment, where I strengthened my soft skills in clear communication, kindness, and empathy.\nAs the company grew, new opportunities emerged, and thanks to my knowledge of internal payroll processes, I was promoted to Payroll Coordinator, a role I continue to hold today.\n\nKey achievements at REDES include:\n\nCreating a comprehensive employee database using Google Forms, Google Sheets, and Microsoft Excel.\nImplementing an employee-code system to streamline bonus payment processing.\nDesigning and implementing a hygiene and safety plan compliant with governmental and federal regulations.\nDeveloping social media content and internal communication materials.\nReducing payroll-related discrepancies by up to 85%.\nAutomating HR processes through Python scripting.\n\n\nAbout two and a half years into this role, I discovered the field of Data Analytics and realized that many aspects of my work were directly related to it. This sparked my interest and led me to enroll in TripleTen’s Data Analysis Bootcamp, a 7-month intensive program based on agile methodologies.\n\nCore competencies developed during the Bootcamp:\n\nProgramming in Python.\nUsing essential libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn.\nFundamentals of statistics.\nA/B testing methodologies.\nCohort-based analysis.\nBusiness Intelligence fundamentals.\nHypothesis testing (Levene, T-Test, Z-Test, Mann-Whitney U, confidence intervals).\n\n\nToday, I combine my background in audio engineering, human resources, and payroll management with my skills in data analytics to approach challenges from both creative and analytical perspectives.\nI am passionate about transforming data into actionable insights, streamlining processes, and delivering results that create a measurable impact. My goal is to keep expanding my expertise and contribute to projects that drive innovation and efficiency."
