# About Me

My name is **Luis Daniel Gutiérrez Renero**, and I hold a **Bachelor’s Degree in Audio Engineering** from *Rec Música Centro de Estudios Musicales*, a recognized institution in Mexico with an official academic partnership with Berklee College of Music (Boston, MA).

My specialization in music was **audio mastering** for digital streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.  
After graduating, I collaborated on mastering projects with artists including **Luis Guinea**, **Rogelio Edel**, and **Alec Roqui**.

While working with these musicians, I also joined a call center company named **REDES**, specializing in debt collection. I began as an **HR Assistant** focusing on recruitment, where I strengthened my soft skills in clear communication, kindness, and empathy.

As the company grew, new opportunities emerged, and thanks to my knowledge of internal payroll processes, I was promoted to **Payroll Coordinator**, a role I continue to hold today.

**Key achievements at REDES include:**
- Creating a comprehensive employee database using Google Forms, Google Sheets, and Microsoft Excel.
- Implementing an employee-code system to streamline bonus payment processing.
- Designing and implementing a hygiene and safety plan compliant with governmental and federal regulations.
- Developing social media content and internal communication materials.
- Reducing payroll-related discrepancies by **up to 85%**.
- Automating HR processes through Python scripting.

About two and a half years into this role, I discovered the field of **Data Analytics** and realized that many aspects of my work were directly related to it. This sparked my interest and led me to enroll in **TripleTen’s Data Analysis Bootcamp**, a 7-month intensive program based on agile methodologies.

**Core competencies developed during the Bootcamp:**
- Programming in Python.
- Using essential libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn.
- Fundamentals of statistics.
- A/B testing methodologies.
- Cohort-based analysis.
- Business Intelligence fundamentals.
- Hypothesis testing (Levene, T-Test, Z-Test, Mann-Whitney U, confidence intervals).

Today, I combine my background in audio engineering, human resources, and payroll management with my skills in data analytics to approach challenges from both creative and analytical perspectives.  
I am passionate about transforming data into actionable insights, streamlining processes, and delivering results that create a measurable impact. My goal is to keep expanding my expertise and contribute to projects that drive innovation and efficiency.
