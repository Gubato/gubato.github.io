# About me

My full name is Luis Daniel Gutiérrez Renero. I have a Bachelor's Degree on Audio Engineering which I gained at Rec Música Centro de Estudios Musicales, a local university here in México.
This university is strongly attached to Berklee College of Music @ Boston, they even have an official partnership.

My specialty on music was audio mastering for streaming on platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, etc.

Once I finished college, I made some mastering work with some artists like Luis Guinea, Rogelio Edel, Alec Roqui.

Meanwhile I was working with all these musicians I started a job at a Call Center named REDES. It is a Collection Call Center.
Here I started a position as an HR with recruitment tasks. I gained a lot of experience on soft skills such as clear communication, being kind and practice empathy.
